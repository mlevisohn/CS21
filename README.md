This project was an assignment for the Brandeis course COSI 21A. 
The project involved coding our own classes for heaps, hash maps, and minimum priority queues. 
The end goal was to use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a map given points on a grid and weighted edges for each adjacent direction. 
While fairly simplified, the ideas from this assignment translate to a traffic algorithm that calculates the quickest way to get to a certain destination.
